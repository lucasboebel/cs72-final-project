# environment
to create a virtual enironment:  ```python -m venv env```
to activate venv, run ```source env/bin/activate```
once inside venv, run ``python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt``
if you still have issues, you might need to run the file from the terminal inside the venv ```python bert_model.py``` or ```python3 bert_models.py```
